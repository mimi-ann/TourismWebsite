<h1>Our goal</h1>
<p>
Our goal as Mzansi Tourism, is to promote South Africas 3 most beautifull coast destinations for tourism which are Cape Town, 
Durban and Port Elizabeth because of the beauty of the cities as well as the nature around the coast. We are also very keen on reducing the global 
warming effect in our Country and the world at large.

<h2 id="Attributes">We focus on the 4 most important attributes to promote our country:</h2>
<li>Food</li>
<p>
The South African cuisine reflects the diverse range of culinary traditions embodied by the various communities that inhabit the country. Among the indigenous peoples of South Africa, the Khoisan foraged over 300 species of edible food plants, such as the rooibos shrub legume, whose culinary value continues to exert a salient influence on South African cuisine. Subsequent encounters with Bantu pastoralists facilitated the emergence of cultivated crops and domestic cattle, which supplemented traditional Khoisan techniques of meat preservation.In addition, Bantu-speaking communities forged an extensive repertoire of culinary ingredients and dishes, many of which are still consumed today in traditional settlements and urban entrepôts alike. By the seventeenth century, Dutch - and later British - colonization and settlement of the Cape Colony resulted in further culinary diffusion. Cape Coloured and Cape Malay communities founded a distinctive diasporic cuisine, derived largely from Malaysian and Indonesian culinary traditions, while Afrikaner voortrekkers further inland adapted Dutch, Khoisan, Cape Malay and Bantu foodways to accommodate their peripatetic lifestyle. In addition, French Huguenot refugees, many of whom settled in Franschhoek, played an instrumental role in developing South Africa's viticultural industry.

<li>Activities</li>
<p>
The South African tourism has many fun things to offer for tourists of all ages.
South Africa is one of the most diverse and enchanting countries in the world. Exotic combinations of landscapes, people, history and culture offer the traveller a unique and inspiring experience.
South Africa is a heady mix of third and first world cultures - along with the best and least crowded beaches in the world. Throw in wildlife parks such as the The Kruger National Park, Ten UNESCO World Heritage Sites, exquisite beach-side villas for accommodation in Cape Town, beautiful natural scenery, a great infrastructure and a stable post-apartheid environment and you have a great destination waiting to happen.

<li>Wildlife</li>
<p>
Best known are the mammals, and the best known of these are the famous Big Five: elephant, lion, rhino, leopard and buffalo. Not that giraffe, hippo or whale are small …
South Africa’s bushveld and savannah regions are still home to large numbers of the mammals universally associated with Africa.
The Kruger National Park alone has well over 10 000 elephants and 20 000 buffaloes – in 1920 there were an estimated 120 elephants left in the whole of South Africa.
The white rhino has also been brought back from the brink of extinction and now flourishes both in the Kruger National Park and the Hluhluwe Umfolozi Park in KwaZulu-Natal. Attention now is on protecting the black rhino.
Both these parks are home to all of the Big Five, as are other major reserves in South Africa – such as Pilanesberg in North West province – and numerous smaller reserves and private game lodges.

<li>Eco friendly hotels</li>
<p>
 As more and more travelers are becoming aware of how important it is to adopt eco friendly principles in South Africa so too are establishments. By adopting various "green values", "sustainable or responsible tourism" or going completely green, these establishments are making a difference in South Africa. SA-Venues.com offers the responsible tourist an array of green accommodation to choose from to suit any budget.
Booking green accommodation in South Africa doesn't mean you need to forfeit comfort for an eco-friendly option. There are plenty of eco accommodation and hotel options throughout the country that offer both green principles and luxurious comfort.
