<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p style="color:white;font-size: 18px">Port Elizabeth is a city on Algoa Bay in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province. A major port, it's also known for its numerous beaches. The Donkin Heritage Trail takes in the Old Hill neighbourhood's Victorian landmarks. Coastal boat tours spot whales and rare seabirds, while wildlife reserves outside the metropolitan area are home to elephants, rhinos and other big game.</p>

<p style="color:white;font-size: 18px" >
On the Eastern Cape, Port Elizabeth, called "PE" by the locals, is South Africa's third largest port, with some of the country's cleanest city beaches. With more than 40 kilometers of coastline lapped by the clear waters of beautiful Algoa Bay, water sports run the gamut here, from surfing, sailing, swimming, and fishing to windsurfing, kiteboarding, and scuba diving. Travelers who prefer to stay dry can hop aboard a harbor cruise with the chance to spot whales such as humpbacks, Southern right whales, and Bryde's whales, depending on the time of year.

<h2 style= "color:Blue"> 2.The Boardwalk</h2><br>
<img src = "https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/SAF/south-africa-port-elizabeth-the-boardwalk.jpg">
<p style="color:white;font-size: 18px">In Summerstrand, a 12-minute walk from the beach, The Boardwalk is a slickly packaged leisure resort and convention center on an artificial lake. Tourists and locals come here to browse the boutiques and specialty stores, dine at the restaurants and cafes, and enjoy the entertainment venues, which include a five-screen cinema, an amphitheater hosting live shows, an amusement arcade, bowling alley, and adventure golf. The fitness center features two pools, and those seeking a little pampering can relax at the full-service spa.

At night, the complex comes alive with a musical fountain show. More than 100 individual jets shoot water up to 60 meters into the air, illuminated by colorful lights, and a screen of water displays multimedia presentations. Adults and children of all ages will find something fun to see and do here, and it's a great alternative to the beach on wet weather days.

The largest is at Rhodes University. The climbing community is fairly small, but quite active & welcoming.

<p style="color:white;font-size: 18px">
The bones of the Algoasaurus, a unique dinosaur to the Nelson Mandela Bay Area related to the Brontosaurus, were discovered near Despatch in 1903. The Port Elizabeth Brick and Tile Company was quarrying for brick-making materials when the brickmakers stumbled across the bones. Unfortunately, they didn’t realise what they’d found and ground up some of the bones for bricks. Luckily, quite a few remained which enabled the archaeologist Robert Broom to construct a likeness of the dinosaur.
<br>
The museum is the third oldest of its kind in South Africa. Other interesting exhibits include a skeleton of the last southern right whale harpooned in the bay, and a replica of the Dias Cross. With your NMB pass, you get free entrance to Bayworld.
<br>
Kids under three years get free entry.

Through several interventions and staff behavioural changes, the award-winning 5-star eco hotel is saving over R1-million every year on water and energy costs and, according to its general manager, Mike van Vuuren, is on track to achieve its ‘green’ goals in 2018.
