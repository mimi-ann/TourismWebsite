<h1>Cape Town:The Mother City</h1>

<p>
The city of Cape Town had its origin in 1652, when the Dutch East India Company established a refreshment station for its ships on the shores of Table Bay. The location was magnificent, on well-watered, fertile soil, beneath the precipitous walls of Table Mountain.
</p>

<br>
<p>
In 2018, the readers of Travel + Leisure named Cape Town one of only 15 “World’s Best” cities. Thanks to the Mother City’s unique blend of natural beauty and captivating cultural attractions, it’s easy to see why the city remains at the top of many travelers’ bucket lists. Following an incredible recovery from a water shortage in 2018, in which residents and travelers alike rallied together to save water, Cape Town’s travel and tourism sector is “open for business”! Travelers looking to support sustainable tourism and sample some of Africa’s extraordinary experiences in 2019, should look no further than this astonishing city.
</p>

<br>

<p>
BREATHTAKING NATURAL BEAUTY<br>
One of the many reasons that travelers choose to visit Cape Town is its abundance of scenic beauty and natural attractions. The city itself is situated between the Atlantic Ocean and Table Mountain, one of the world’s Seven Wonders of Nature. Table Mountain’s iconic plateau forms the dramatic backdrop of the city and is a must-see for visitors. We recommend taking the cableway to zip to the top of the mountain, which sits over 3,400 feet above the city, since it allows 360-degree panoramic views of the surrounding area. Once at the top, you can freely hike and explore the area to take in truly awe-inspiring views of the Western Cape.

GOURMET FOOD & WORLD-CLASS WINE<br>
Capetonians love their food, so it’s little wonder that Cape Town is one of the leading culinary destinations in Africa. The region is known for its seafood, thanks to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The diverse sushi selections at Willoughby & Co., situated in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, are a local favorite as are the fresh oysters that are served daily at the 12 Apostles Hotel & Spa’s Azure Restaurant. Cape Town is also home to a rich culinary history from the Cape Malay people, who came to the region from Malaysia in the 1600s, bringing with them flavorful foods such as curry and chutney. For adventurous culinary tourists, we recommend taking a cooking class with renowned chef Cass Abrahams to learn some of the secrets of the tasty Cape Malay cuisine.

<h1 id="Mother City">What the Mother City has to offer</h1>

<h2 id="Food">Food:</h2>
<li>Fish and Chips</li>
<img style="float:right" src="fish.jpg">
<p>Cape Town’s proximity to flourishing oceans and history of British colonial rule has resulted in a vibrant fish and chips culture. This reveals itself in various forms—from casual street food style eateries and hole-in-the-wall hatches serving up deep-fried fish and chips through to high-end line fish served at top restaurants. Most fish served in Cape Town is fresh and worth exploring. If you want to keep it traditional, head to a specialist fish and chips shop, preferably by the ocean, and order a portion of deep-fried hake or snoek with chips. Kalky’s in Kalk Bay and Snoekies in Hout Bay are two original shops to visit. It may not be the healthiest option, but it’s tasty, cheap, and the perfect accompaniment to a day by the sea.</p>

<br>
<li>Biltong and Droëwors</li>
<img style="float:right" src="biltong.jpg"><br>
<p>Less a dish and more a snack, this is the staple bar or road trip food in many South African diets. Biltong and droëwors are made by drying meat and adding a special blend of spices. Biltong is simply cured and dried, and then sliced or left in solid sticks. Droëwors is essentially a dried sausage. Though on paper both sound slightly bizarre, most meat eaters consider them as addictive snacks. You’ll find biltong and droëwors of varying quality in all supermarkets and as snacks at some pubs, bars, and restaurants.</p>
<br>
<li>Braai</li>
<img style="float:right" src="braai.jpg"><br>
<p>Braai is one of the first Afrikaans words that most tourists learn. It’s essentially the South African take on the traditional barbecue, with a few local twists. Braais are usually meat heavy and take place in backyards. There’s no real restriction on what you can braai, but most include boerewors, a local spiced sausage, beef steak, and pork or lamb chops. Some food-orientated hotels and backpackers will schedule traditional braais for guests. Or you can pay a visit to the popular Mzoli’s in Guguletu, where you choose meat from the fridge before handing it over to the experts to cook over open flames.</p>

<br>

<h3 id="Wildlife">Wildlife:</h3>

<li>African penguin</li>
<img style="float:right" src="Penguin.jpg"><br>
<p>African penguins, formerly known as jackass penguins because of the braying sound they make, are the only penguins who inhabit the African continent. At only 68-70cm tall and weighing 2-5kg, they are surprisingly small compared to their larger Empire and King penguin cousins. African penguins can swim at an impressive 20km/h and can dive to a depth of 130m in pursuit of fish, crustaceans and small squid. Tragically, despite measures from the South African government to protect the birds, the African penguin is an endangered species, their population having dropped from four million at the beginning of the 19th century to 200,000 at the beginning of the 21st, to only 55,000 today.</p>
<br><p>Where to see them: the lively but stinky penguin colony installed at the aptly named Boulders Beach in Simon's Town, 40km south of Cape Town, is the best place to see these endearing little birds. From just two breeding pairs in 1983, today the colony numbers approximately 3000, though this number is now dropping at a worrying pace. There are three boardwalks beyond which you’re not allowed to pass, but you’ll be able to observe them up close, breeding, nesting, waddling, swimming, and interacting with each other and with their young. There’s an entrance fee of R152 as Boulders Beach forms part of Table Mountain National Park. The fee goes toward the conservation of the penguins. If you want to avoid the crowds — of humans, that is — walk about five minutes southeast to the small cove. There may be a few penguins there, but nothing close to what you’ll find at the official site.</p>
<br>
<li>Rock hyrax</li>
<img style="float:right" src="rock-hyrax.jpg"><br>
<p>More commonly known to locals as rock dassies, these furry little herbivores are no larger than a groundhog, though they’re actually the closest living relative to the elephant. Dassies are characterised by short, stocky bodies, small ears, short tails, sweet liquid brown eyes, black button noses, and thin, curved lips that give the uneasy impression they’re smiling when they’re staring at you. As their name implies, dassies favour rocky, mountainous areas where there a lot of large boulders between which they can find shelter and shade, and atop which they enjoy basking in the sun in the early morning and late afternoon.</p>
<br><p>Where to see them: at Table Mountain hanging out on the rocks around the park or by the cable car, or co-existing with the penguins at Boulders Beach, between Simon’s Town and Cape Point.</p>
<br>
<li>Malachite kingfisher</li>
<img style="float:right" src="King fisher.jpg"><br>
<p>With more than 610 recorded bird species in Cape Town, the Mother City is a birder’s paradise. One of the most colourful and most striking of Cape Town’s avian species is the malachite kingfisher. The bird is common in South Africa but also elusive, which explains why birders and photographers are so keen to capture them with their lenses. At only 3cm long, these Lilliputian river kingfishers are tough to spot from a distance, but their purple, black, malachite green and bright metallic blue plumage and long orange beaks help make them stand out.</p>
<p>Where to see them: malachite kingfishers are attracted to wetland habitats. In Cape Town you can observe them from the bird hides at Rietvlei Wetland Reserve, a 15-minute drive from the CBD, or at Intaka Island, a wetland and bird sanctuary curiously located within the grounds of a shopping centre.</p>

<h4 id="Things to do">Things to do:</h4>

<li>TAKE THE CABLEWAY TO THE TOP OF TABLE MOUNTAIN</li>
<p>
If you think the view of Table Mountain from Cape Town is epic, just wait till you’re standing atop Table Mountain and looking out over Cape Town and the city bowl…!
A trip to the top of Table Mountain is a must during your visit to the Mother City, though you’ll have to time your visit carefully as the mountain’s weather can be pretty unpredictable (it basically creates its own weather patterns). 
You’ll quickly become familiar with the city’s ‘tablecloth’ - a thick blanket of clouds that roll in over the top of and whiteout everything. If you see Table Mountain begin to rise from the city bowl with no clouds nearby - go, go, go!
The Table Mountain aerial cableway has been ferrying passengers to the top of Table Mountain for almost 90 years, and with its 360* rotating floor and epic views its definitely worth taking the ride. 
Tickets are around USD R225 per adult but are seasonal, so check before you go.
You can also combine your cableway ride with any other Cape Town sightseeing you want to do by purchasing a combined aerial cableway and hop-on-hop-off bus pass here.

<h2 id="Hotels">Eco friendly hotels in Cape Town:</h2>

<li>Grootbos Nature Reserve</li>
<p>
Nestled between mountains, forest and sea, Grootbos is a luxury eco-reserve around a two-hour drive from Cape Town and a leading example of sustainable tourism set within hectares upon hectares of indigenous fynbos and ancient milkwood forests. Michael Lutzeyer first spotted an opportunity back in the early ’90s when he bought a small farm on a plot of land near Walker Bay Nature Reserve in the Western Cape. The reserve started as a small bed and breakfast, but Lutzeyer quickly realised there was an opportunity to create something bigger. Over the past few decades, this eco-reserve has positioned itself as a leader in progressive luxury tourism through its commitment to supporting community and living in harmony with nature. Part of its approach includes preserving 2,500 hectares (6,178 acres) of plant life and wildlife, including three milkwood forests that are over 1,000 years old, 800 plant species, 118 bird species, 29 mammals and 21 amphibians. Conservation aside, the hotel has made small changes and encourages their guests to do the same. For example, single-use plastics are banned, and there is a huge emphasis on using collected rainwater. Staff also make use of eco-friendly cleaning materials instead of harsh detergents, and solar panels generate power. Much of the food served at Grootbos is grown organically on the reserve, while the owners are involved in many nature conservation and community upliftment projects. The reserve’s efforts have been rewarded with several accolades, including World Travel Market’s Responsible Tourism Award. The accommodation isn’t half bad either – with spacious en-suite rooms, cosy fireplaces and private decks with breathtaking views.

<li>Hotel Verde</li>
<p>
Hotel Verde is rated the greenest hotel in Africa by the US Green Building Council. Apart from providing luxurious accommodation, the hotel uses energy-efficient and water-saving devices and employs a ‘zero waste to landfill’ policy by reusing, recycling and composting, among other eco-friendly practices. It’s the first hotel in Africa to offer guests a fully carbon-neutral stay, which is offset by benefiting local communities living in and around Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe. It does this by creating new jobs, strengthening social infrastructure and protecting the local wildlife through supporting and helping those to rebuild forest cover. Each guest receives a certificate proving this on checkout. The hotel also has a water-recycling system that saves an average of 6,000 litres (1,585 gallons) of water a day. Hotel Verde also collects rainwater using 40,000-litre (10,567-gallon) stainless-steel tanks and has subsoil drainage systems in place, and all the water from that is used to wash cars and external building sites owned by the hotel. Meanwhile, three wind turbines and 220 solar panels generate energy. Guests can also do their bit and create power by walking up the stairs and taking the lift down, or heading to the gym to use the hotel’s energy-generating equipment. All the hotel’s lights are energy-saving LEDs, and it goes even further by sorting through all of its waste. It aims to send nothing to landfill. Food waste is either composted or fed to worms so that it goes back into the ecosystem, while the restaurant also prides itself on locally produced and responsibly sourced meals. And if you drive an electric car, you can benefit from priority parking. All the hotel’s efforts have seen it win numerous awards, including the ‘Most Responsible’ badge by World Travel Market Africa in 2017. Hotel Verde’s proximity to the Cape Town International Airport as well as the city’s main attractions adds to its allure.

<li>The Vineyard</li>
<p>
As it’s built on three hectares (eight acres) of land, one of the biggest challenges for The Vineyard has been maintaining the estate (the original house dates back to the 1800s) and its biodiversity, including 9,000 plant species, of which 70 percent are unique to the Western Cape. The hotel, on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, goes about this with regular clear-ups and natural principles, which extend to the surrounding river and beach. The hotel’s commitment to sustainability continues with renewable energy, and it has 80 solar panels, which have been supplied by the nearby Darling Wind Farm. It also has a 98 percent waste-recycling system and several water-saving initiatives. It also prides itself on sustainable and ethically produced cuisine; the garden lounge and patio at The Vineyard are perfect places in which to dine out on a delicious afternoon tea, which is served daily between 3.30pm and 5.30pm and offers a mix of sweet and savoury items. The rooms all come in various shapes and sizes, but they’re unified through a ‘living green’ ethos, which sees all rooms installed with water- and energy-saving devices, such as timers on showers to monitor use. Art on the walls are created using recycled paper, and guests are actively encouraged to reuse their towels and linen for an entire stay. It too has been recognised by the international Skål Sustainable Tourism Awards.
